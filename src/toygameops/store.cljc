  "SSoT for the ISIC-4764 'Retail sale of games and toys in specialized
  stores' operations-COORDINATION actor, behind a `Store` protocol so the
  backend is a swap, not a rewrite -- the same seam every
  `cloud-itonami-isic-*` actor in this fleet uses.

  This actor coordinates the back-office operations of a specialized
  games/toys storefront: sales/inventory/return transaction logging,
  floor-staff scheduling, merchandise supply-order coordination with
  registered vendors, and product-SAFETY-concern flagging (choking/
  small-parts hazards, suspected recall-affected stock, apparent
  age-grading label mismatches). It never sets or authorizes a shelf
  price, and -- critically for a child-product-safety domain -- it never
  directly finalizes a recall-compliance decision or an age-grading-
  safety decision. See `toygameops.governor`'s `scope-exclusion-
  violations`, a HARD, permanent, un-overridable block.

  `MemStore` -- atom of EDN. The deterministic default for dev/tests/demo
  (no deps). A `stores` directory keyed by `:store-id` STRING and a
  `vendors` directory keyed by `:vendor-id` STRING (never keywords --
  consistent keying from the start, avoiding the silent-miss bug that has
  plagued earlier sibling actors).

  A registered/verified store record (business registration + retail
  license) must exist before ANY proposal targeting that store may ever
  commit or escalate -- `toygameops.governor`'s `store-unverified-
  violations` re-derives this from the store's own `:registered?`/
  `:verified?` fields, never from proposal self-report. A
  `:coordinate-supply-order` proposal additionally names a registered
  vendor via its own `:vendor-id`; the SAME 'ground truth, not
  self-report' discipline applies via `vendor-unverified-violations`.

  The ledger stays append-only: which store a proposal targeted, which
  operation, on what basis, committed/held/escalated and approved by whom
  is always a query over an immutable log.")
