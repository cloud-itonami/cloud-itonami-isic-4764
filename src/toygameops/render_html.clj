(ns toygameops.render-html
  "Build-time HTML renderer for `docs/samples/operator-console.html`.

  Closes flagship checklist item 2 (com-junkawasaki/root ADR-2607189300,
  Wave1 Lane A-no-demo): this repo previously had NO demo page and no
  generator at all. This namespace drives the REAL actor stack
  (`toygameops.operation` -> `toygameops.governor` -> `toygameops.store`)
  through a scenario adapted from this repo's own `toygameops.sim` demo
  driver (`clojure -M:dev:run`, confirmed BEFORE writing this file to
  produce a sensible ledger against the real seeded store ids
  `store-1`..`store-3` and vendor ids `vendor-1`..`vendor-2` -- ids that
  DO match `toygameops.store/demo-data`, so it was safe to reuse rather
  than author from scratch), trimmed to a representative subset (clean
  auto-commits, always-escalate ops that a human then approves, and
  five distinct HARD-hold reasons including vendor-unverified) and
  rendered deterministically -- no invented numbers, no timestamps in
  the page content, byte-identical across reruns against the same seed
  (verify by diffing two consecutive runs).

  Usage: `clojure -M:dev:render-html [out-file]`
  (default `docs/samples/operator-console.html`)."

  "Runs a fresh seeded store through a scenario mixing every disposition
  this actor can reach: store-1 clears a clean sales-record log (phase-3
  auto-commit), a staffing-operation schedule (auto-commit), a low-cost
  supply-order coordination naming verified vendor-1 (auto-commit), a
  high-cost supply-order (ALWAYS escalates -- approved), and a product-
  safety-concern flag (ALWAYS escalates -- approved); store-99 HARD-
  holds as unregistered; store-3 HARD-holds as registered-but-
  unverified; a supply-order naming unverified vendor-2 HARD-holds on
  vendor-unverified; a staffing proposal whose advisor injects
  `:effect :commit` HARD-holds on effect-not-propose; a sales-record
  proposal that drifts into recall-compliance / age-grading-safety
  finalization scope HARD-holds permanently. Every HARD hold never
  reaches a human. Returns the resulting store -- every field read by
  `render` below is real governor/store output, not a hand-typed copy."
