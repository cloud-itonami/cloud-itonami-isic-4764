# Security Policy

This project handles retail-store operations and product-safety-concern
workflows for a child-product (games and toys) domain. Treat
vulnerabilities as potentially high impact even when the demo data is
synthetic.

## Do Not Disclose Publicly

Report privately before opening public issues for:

- credential exposure
- real customer, employee or supplier data exposure
- authorization bypass
- ToyGameRetailGovernor bypass (including anything that would let a
  proposal directly finalize a recall-compliance or age-grading-safety
  decision)
- audit-ledger tampering
- over-disclosure in safety-concern reports or exports
- tenant isolation failures

## Reporting

Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting when available for the repository.
If that is unavailable, contact the repository maintainers through the
cloud-itonami organization before publishing details.

Include:

- affected commit or version
- reproduction steps
- expected and actual behavior
- impact on customer/employee/supplier data, policy enforcement or audit logging
- suggested fix, if known

## Production Guidance

- Store secrets outside Git.
- Keep real customer, employee and supplier data outside this repository.
- Run policy tests before deployment.
- Export and review audit logs regularly.
- Use least privilege for operators and service accounts.
- Route every product-safety-concern flag to a human with the authority
  and training to actually adjudicate recall-compliance and age-grading
  questions -- this actor structurally cannot do that itself.
